                <p>Computational technology has produced some of the most harmful and destructive outcomes in the world, yet the discipline is not portrayed or treated with the seriousness it warrants. Students learning to code and creating computational technology products often do so without understanding these critical issues. Considering imperial dynamics, Western capitalist companies develop and use technologies to profit from and exploit populations in the third world/global south. Technologies are increasingly used as mediums, and even arbiters, of decision-making, yet the implications of this are not deeply considered by those in the field of computer science. If educational institutions do not provide the opportunity for computer scientists to learn and understand these issues, it is unclear where they will gain this crucial knowledge. While it may be difficult to enforce repercussions for ignorance, there is a moral obligation to understand these ethical concerns. The repercussions of computer scientists lacking this education are not formally measured, but we can clearly see the consequences with major tech conglomerates producing weapons of mass destruction, exploiting and outsourcing labor to the global south, and unethically mining user data. There is a significant dissonance between the abstraction of computer science development and its real-world applications, which should be deeply concerning to everyone.

                <p>Throughout my four years in undergraduate, I [FINISH THE SENTENCE]. My first semester of college, I participated in a directed reading seminar [INSERT COURSE NAME AND LINK], led by Professor Kevin Webb, whom I would continuously work with on [INSERT BLANK BLANK BLANK]. I also joined the student club, Tech for Social Good, that year where [BLANK BLANK BLANK‚Ä¶ working with other students who were passionate about using technology for social good.] 
                </p>
                <p>The following year, as I continued [with Tech for Social Good], I also became a founding member of YX foundation, a [INSERT DESCRIPTION HERE], where I was able to work with other students across universities [‚Ä¶finish the sentence]. This was also the year where I started heavily self-studying STS (be more specific of my interests) which was really hard at this school without programmatic support. However, I took [Surveillance‚Ä¶full course and potential link?] also really [solidified, made a mark‚Ä¶.] and wanted to engage in these optics within a classroom setting with other students, which led to the development of the student-led course.  The spring semester, did a directed reading with Edwin Mayorga in hopes of drafting a syllabus to prepare for a student-led course to teach the following fall semester. That summer, I was fortunate to partake in a Human Computer Interaction research fellowship with Danae Mexata where [INSERT DESCRIPTION]. Thankful for all I‚Äôve learned through these opportunities, wanted to do something more directly within my CS department which was the motivation for creating the student-led course, working with my co-student facilitator Sidhika and Professor Kevin Webb during that summer to solidify the details of the course.

CS department who saw the importance but still had lots of questions/concerns/issues in long-term, more permanent integrations ‚Ä¶ 
                </p>
                <p>Understanding the ever-increasing importance of integrating socially conscious perspectives into the course curricula, I aimed to undertake a more formal and in-depth exploration of how the department can evolve to better incorporate ethical and social considerations into its teachings. This exploration also considers how other departments at liberal arts colleges and universities can implement similar changes. While students passionate about these issues can initiate temporary changes, their time in school is limited to four years. Therefore, I sought to engage in conversations about long-term departmental changes and strategies. These discussions include ways in which faculty, as well as current and future students, can sustain and advance this critical work.

                <p style = "font-style: italic;">thesis summary</p>
                <p>My undergraduate thesis consolidates my special major in Computer Science and Educational Studies in exploring the continuation of the social and ethically conscious curriculum in my school‚Äôs computer science department. In retrospect, I realize that the term ‚Äúsocially and ethically conscious curriculum,‚Äù which I used throughout my thesis, inadequately conveys the integration of critical issues such as the global atrocities driven by tech companies and their connections to us as aspiring computer scientists. This phrase [is not helpful] in framing these objectives as inherent to the field rather than supplemental, in so that every discipline and its curricula, in adhering to the BLANK or moral standards in education, should be ‚Äúsocially and ethically conscious‚Äù. 
                </p>
                <p>In many ways, I felt that my thesis was over-articulating what should be incredibly obvious. My continuous push to integrate the social implications of technology into core conversations was making an argument that should not even be necessary. Ultimately, it was a matter of consciously prioritizing these discussions within both student and faculty curricula, where these conversations do not have direct support or emphasis, in order to create a more ethically aware and socially responsible discipline.

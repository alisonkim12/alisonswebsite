                <p style = "padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.5px solid black; font-size: 0.7em !important;">[ <span style = "font-weight: bold;">June 2023 - August 2024</span> ] : <span style = "font-style: italic;">I took a career hiatus to recover from back and shoulder issues, as well as to address immigration-related matters. During this period, I was not actively working or seeking employment.</span></p>
                <p>I am a computer scientist who focuses on full-stack development, and works dominantly on interpreting and visualizing data. My technical background primarily encompasses building data-driven, web-based applications, with experience in data scraping and analysis, machine learning modeling, and real-time geovisualization. I am particularly passionate about building computational tools that illuminate and/or mitigate systemic issues related to race, gender, and class.</p>
                <p>Recently, during my hiatus:</p>
                <p style = "margin-left: 2em;">A) I had the pleasure of conducting research for renowned trans scholar <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riki_Wilchins" target="_blank">Riki Wilchins'</a> forthcoming books, <a href = "https://www.nlgja.org/blog/2024/07/bad-ink-how-the-new-york-times-sold-out-transgender-teens/" target="_blank">including her latest book</a> on how mainstream news outlets derail trans rights by spreading inaccurate, fear-mongering misinformation.</p>
                <p style = "margin-left: 2em;">B) I also experimented with building several programs during my recovery. See more details about these projects below and on my <i class="ri-github-fill"> </i><a href = "https://github.com/alisonkim12" target="_blank">github</a> .</p>

                        <li class = "visible"><span style = "font-weight: bold;">DATA-DRIVEN PROJECTS</span> : I was part of the ‘Boring Cities’ project at Princeton’s <a href = "https://evictionlab.org" target="_blank">Eviction Lab</a> establishing a causal relationship between property consolidation, corporate land ownership, and whether cities are getting more boring by scraping NAICS and USTaxData datasets and training a machine learning model of "third spaces" in major U.S. cities. I designed and implemented a search engine and geovisualization tool, compiling nationwide datasets of healthcare resources for sexual assault victims to identify nearby hospitals equipped for Sexual Assault Forensic Exams and locate sexual assault professionals, including IAFN-certified nurses, therapists, social workers, and counselors, enabling real-time, location-based data processing and visualization for <a href = "https://leda.co" target="_blank">LEDA Health</a>. I've also prototyped and published independent work leveraging data from API integrations and text classification models, from <a href = "/projects/play-with-music/index.html" target="_blank">visualizing spotify playlists</a> and <a href = "/projects/trail-of-prayers/" target="_blank">spatializing writings from female mystics</a> to <a href = "/projects/nature-cam/index.html" target="_blank">geo-mapping nature live cams</a>.</li>
                        <li><span style = "font-weight: bold;">TECHNOLOGY AND EQUITY</span> : I’ve conducted Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research with <a href = "https://metaxa.net/" target = "_blank">Danaë Mexata</a> through <a href = "https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/prospective-graduate-programs/summer" target="_blank">Stanford’s Undergraduate Research Fellowship</a> developing a framework to understand the political tension between visibility and vulnerability for marginalized creators, businesses, and user experiences on digital platforms following the advent of 2020 BLM. For two years, I was an executive board member of Swarthmore’s Tech for Social Good (part of <a href = "https://www.techshift.org/" target="_blank">TechShift alliance</a>) where I helped prototype curricular reforms to integrate ethics and social issues into existing CS courses, collaborating with professors to refine their course through a multidisciplinary approach, and managed a bi-monthly digest on current events and digital resources on various topics regarding social applications and implications of technology. I developed and taught a semester-long, <a href = "https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/courses/CS16/F21/" target="_blank">student-led seminar</a> in my CS department examining the intersections of technology and society through the lenses of critical race theory, feminist theory, disability theory, and decolonial theory. I’ve served as part of my college’s <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/computer-science/advisory-council-to-cs-department-accs" target="_blank">Advisory Council to the CS Department</a> for three years, including as part of the inaugural cohort, as well as on the Natural Sciences and Engineering Student Advisory Council for Inclusive Excellence, where I focused on increasing student retention and support for women of color and students from non-technical backgrounds; I am also a part of University of Washington’s <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/" target="_blank">AccessComputing</a>, a national community of computer science students with disabilities. 
                        </li>
                        <li><span style = "font-weight: bold;">CS EDUCATION</span> : My work in CS education is centered around expanding access to who is able to create and criticize technology. As a Computer Science and Educational Studies major, my undergraduate <a href = "https://works.swarthmore.edu/theses/273" target="_blank">thesis</a> posits that the societal and ethical dimension of CS are and should be taught as inextricable to the fundamentals of the discipline. In situating the thesis within my college’s CS department, I articulate history of departmental and curricular reforms undertaken to this commitment, and present a broader argument of its necessity within the principles of CS education within the liberal arts. From 2022 - 2023, I served as a student advisory member with 7 other undergraduates across the country for <a href = "https://identityincs.org/aiice-overview/" target="_blank">Alliance for Identity-Inclusive Computing Education</a>, under the leadership of Dr. Nicki Washington.  NSE... I worked as a student researcher within the Educational Gaming Environments group team at <a href = "https://terc.edu" target="_blank">Technical Education Research Center</a> under the mentorship of Dr. Teon Edwards, designing a comprehensive and inclusive curriculum for computational thinking for grades 3-8 students with cognitive/learning disabilities.</li>
                        <li><span style = "font-weight: bold;">EDUCATION ACCESS / IMMIGRANT RIGHTS</span> : I have also been deeply involved in programmatic initiatives a) increasing educational access to marginalized communities and b) as an immigrants rights activist and community organizer – often in tandem, improving educational opportunities for undocumented immigrants. In a year-long fellowship with <a href= "https://immigrantsrising.org/" target="_blank">Immigrants Rising</a>, I had the pleasure of working directly with career counselors and students in an immigrant-dominant high school in Huntington Park, CA., developing long term programmatic resources and hosting monthly college application workshops for their undocumented students. I created and co-led an 8 week immersive program in the summer of 2020 for ~30 immigrant high school students in south Philadelphia on applying to college, collaborating with other constituents focusing on immigrant rights and educational access including <a href = "https://www.vamosjuntos.org/" target="_blank">Juntos</a>, <a href = "https://nakasec.org/" target="_blank">NAKASEC</a>, <a href = "https://www.wooricenterpa.org/" target="_blank">Woori Center</a>, admissions offices from <a href = "https://www.duq.edu/" target="_blank">Duquesne University</a>, <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/" target="_blank">Swarthmore College</a>, <a href = "https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html" target="_blank">Villanova University</a>, and directly organizing with <a href = "http://paimmigrant.org/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Immigration Citizenship Coalition</a> to increase capacity building for PA’s SB393/394 legislature. During my freshman and sophomore year, I mobilized to reinstate Swarthmore College’s <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/sanctuary-swarthmore/sanctuary-committee" target="_blank">Sanctuary Committee</a> serving as a student representative, focusing on co-curricular opportunities and support. With the help of faculty advocates, I worked with administrators to institute a permanent policy change to open funding and eligibility for research programs and fellowships for undocumented students at the college. I also interned as a graphic designer at <a href = "https://www.milliegroup.com" target="_blank">MILLIE</a>, a college access and mentoring consultancy serving 10,000 international high school students, where I designed informational eBooks to be used as educational materials in their curriculum.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p style = "margin-top: 1em;">My work has been recognized with awards and fellowships from the <a href = "https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center" target="_blank">Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility</a>, <a href = "https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/prospective-graduate-programs/summer" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>, <a href= "https://www.i3-inclusion.org" target="_blank">ischool inclusion institute</a>, <a href= "https://immigrantsrising.org/" target="_blank">Immigrants Rising</a>, <a href= "https://www.questbridge.org/" target="_blank">Questbridge</a>, among others.</p>

    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>I foreground my interest within human beings â€“ and the conditions to which our relational subjectivities to one another and our environment shapes our self-experience. I am interested in the psychosocial factors that shape the production of constitutive value and how this comes to be reified and projected onto digital mediums. For instance, examining <em>what</em> kinds of knowledge and community are produced and <em>how</em> they are formed allows us to understand the values and fears that drive society and our lived experience. I study technology by analyzing how humans extend such behaviors to digital mediums. From the construction of computational language, tools, and systems to how they are engaged en masse, I hope to explore its materialization on a computational and social level. To me, this is to think through developmental practices in design and how its efficacy is measured. This is also to think through what such products <em>assume</em> about subjectivity, where I hope to bridge forms of social theory and metaphysical studies that I consider interesting and important to bring to the discussion.

    <p>Tentatively, I hope to ground this endeavor within the intersection of affect and computing.</p>
